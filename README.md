# PPPGISr
PPGISr is an R package for implementing public participatory GIS. PPGIS refers to spatially explicit methods for capturing and using spatial information in participatory planning processes, decision-making, and scientific inquiry(Rambaldi et al., 2006, Sieber, 2006, Lowery and Morse, 2013; Rambaldi and Callosa-Tarr, 2001). Applications include identifying participant preferences for future land use and management (Brown & KÃ¿tta, 2014), pinpointing valued locations for conservation(ref), and design of urban landscapes(ref) to name a few. However, the technical hurdles associated with its setup have often limited its use to small-scale experimental exercises. Reducing barriers to using PPGIS may offer new ways for public engagement and data collection that enhance our capacity to pursue decision-making, especially when it can be done online.
